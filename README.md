# Implementation, estimation and evaluation GARCH(1,1) model for S&P 500 daily returns.
The code defines a general garch(returns) function that estimates GARCH parameters and computes standard errors for a given time series of returns. The function takes a time series of returns as input. Inside the function we defined another function garch likelihood(parameters, ret), which takes GARCH parameters and returns as input and calculates the negative log-likelihood of the model given the returns. Using the ‘scipy.optimize.minimize‘ we find parameters that maximize the likelihood. From the optimization result, we ex- tract the optimized parameters of GARCH model and calculate standard errors using the Hessian matrix. The obtained parameters are then used to calculate filtered variance process. The function returns then the optimized parameters, standard errors, and the filtered variance process.
Function simulate future returns uses the GARCH model parameters, filtered variance and return of day T to simulate a 30-day forecast. The function is used to collect the 30-day forecasts for each day in our sample, and returns future returns and filtered volatility. Then the calculate confidence interval is applied on obtained 30-day forecasts and calculates lower and upper quantiles.
Finally, the predicted volatility is plotted with percentiles to see how often the realizations 30 days ahead violate the confidence interval.
